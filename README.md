## OVERVIEW
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a logistic regression model. The analysis is performed on the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers such as age, sex, class, and fare.

## FEATURES
Passenger Class (Pclass): Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Sex: Gender of the passenger (0 = male, 1 = female)
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
Fare: Passenger fare
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (0 = S, 1 = C, 2 = Q)

## TOOLS AND LIBRARY USED
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

## DATA PRE-PROCESSING
Dropped columns: Cabin, PassengerId, Name, Ticket
Handled missing values:
Filled missing Age with the mean age.
Filled missing Embarked values with the mode.

## ACCURACY
Training Data Accuracy: Calculated during runtime
Test Data Accuracy: Calculated during runtime


_This README is concise and provides a clear overview of the project, and what to expect in terms of outputs and accuracy._
